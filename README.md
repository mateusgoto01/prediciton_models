## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This project serves as an introduction to machine learning. It includes the implementation and training of Perceptron and neural network models for various tasks such as regression, digit classification, and language identification.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## üîß Installation <a name = "installation"></a>
To run this project, you will need to install the following libraries:
- `numpy`: for support with large multi-dimensional arrays
- `matplotlib`: a 2D plotting library

To install these libraries, use the following commands:
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
```
## üåü Showcase <a name="showcase"></a>
This section showcases the solutions to each problem:
## Perceptron Training <a name="q1"></a>

Description: Implement and train a Perceptron model to classify linearly separable data. The Perceptron algorithm adjusts weights based on misclassifications during training, aiming to find a decision boundary that separates different classes.

Running the Code: To train and test the Perceptron model, run:
```bas
python autograder.py -q q1
```
